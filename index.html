          Ruth Bader Ginsburg (/ˈbeɪdər ˈɡɪnzbɜːrɡ/ BAY-dər GINZ-burg) was an
          <b>associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States</b>
          from 1993 until her death in September 2020. She was nominated by
          President Bill Clinton, replacing retiring justice Byron White, and at
          the time was generally viewed as a moderate consensus-builder. She
          eventually became part of the liberal wing of the Court as the Court
          shifted to the right over time. Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman
          and the second woman to serve on the Court, after Sandra Day O'Connor.
          During her tenure, Ginsburg wrote notable majority opinions, including
          United States v. Virginia (1996), Olmstead v. L.C. (1999), Friends of
          the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. (2000), and
          City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005).

          Joan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, at Beth Moses Hospital in
          Brooklyn, New York City, the second daughter of Celia (née Amster) and
          Nathan Bader, who lived in the Flatbush neighborhood. Her father was a
          Jewish emigrant from Odessa, Ukraine, at that time part of the Russian
          Empire, and her mother was born in New York to parents who came from
          Kraków, Poland[4]. The Baders' elder daughter Marylin died of
          meningitis at age six, when Ruth was 14 months old. The family called
          Joan Ruth "Kiki", a nickname Marylin had given her for being "a kicky
          baby". When "Kiki" started school, Celia discovered that her
          daughter's class had several other girls named Joan, so Celia
          suggested the teacher call her daughter "Ruth" to avoid confusion.

          In the fall of 1956, Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School, where
          she was one of only 9 women in a class of about 500 men. The dean of
          Harvard Law reportedly invited all the female law students to dinner
          at his family home and asked the female law students, including
          Ginsburg, "Why are you at Harvard Law School, taking the place of a
          man?"

          When her husband took a job in New York City, Ginsburg transferred to
          Columbia Law School and became the first woman to be on two major law
          reviews: the Harvard Law Review and Columbia Law Review. In 1959, she
          earned her law degree at Columbia and tied for first in her class.

        <p class="text-paragraph">
          At the start of her legal career, Ginsburg encountered difficulty in
          finding employment. In 1960, Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter
          rejected Ginsburg for a clerkship position due to her gender. She was
          rejected despite a strong recommendation from Albert Martin Sacks, who
          was a professor and later dean of Harvard Law School. Columbia law
          professor Gerald Gunther also pushed for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of
          the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to hire
          Ginsburg as a law clerk, threatening to never recommend another
          Columbia student to Palmieri if he did not give Ginsburg the
          opportunity and guaranteeing to provide the judge with a replacement
          clerk should Ginsburg not succeed. Later that year, Ginsburg began her
          clerkship for Judge Palmieri, and she held the position for two years.

            said she had “loved our country” and that “she dedicated many of her
            87 remarkable years to the pursuit of justice and equality, and she

          Despite her reputation for restrained writing, she gathered
          considerable attention for her dissenting opinion in the case of Bush
          v. Gore, which effectively decided the 2000 presidential election
          between George W. Bush and Al Gore.
          <br /><br />
          Objecting to the court’s majority opinion favoring Bush, Ginsburg
          deliberately and subtly concluded her decision with the words, “I
          dissent” a significant departure from the tradition of including the
          adverb “respectfully.” She continues to promote women’s rights from
          the High Court and will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in many
          controversial cases in the future.

          On June 27, 2010, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s husband, Martin, died of
          cancer. She described Martin as her biggest booster and “the only
          young man I dated who cared that I had a brain.”
          <br /><br />
          Married for 56 years, as a couple, they were said to be quite
          different: Martin was gregarious, loved to entertain and tell jokes
          while Ruth was serious, soft-spoken and shy. Martin provided a reason
          for their successful union: “My wife doesn’t give me any advice about
          cooking and I don’t give her any advice about the law.”
          <br /><br />
          After 27 years serving as a justice on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader
          Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020 due to complications from
          metastatic pancreas cancer.
