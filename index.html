          Ruth Bader Ginsburg (/ˈbeɪdər ˈɡɪnzbɜːrɡ/ BAY-dər GINZ-burg) was an
          <b>associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States</b>
          from 1993 until her death in September 2020. She was nominated by
          President Bill Clinton, replacing retiring justice Byron White, and at
          the time was generally viewed as a moderate consensus-builder. She
          eventually became part of the liberal wing of the Court as the Court
          shifted to the right over time. Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman
          and the second woman to serve on the Court, after Sandra Day O'Connor.
          During her tenure, Ginsburg wrote notable majority opinions, including
          United States v. Virginia (1996), Olmstead v. L.C. (1999), Friends of
          the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. (2000), and
          City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005).

          Joan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, at Beth Moses Hospital in
          Brooklyn, New York City, the second daughter of Celia (née Amster) and
          Nathan Bader, who lived in the Flatbush neighborhood. Her father was a
          Jewish emigrant from Odessa, Ukraine, at that time part of the Russian
          Empire, and her mother was born in New York to parents who came from
          Kraków, Poland[4]. The Baders' elder daughter Marylin died of
          meningitis at age six, when Ruth was 14 months old. The family called
          Joan Ruth "Kiki", a nickname Marylin had given her for being "a kicky
          baby". When "Kiki" started school, Celia discovered that her
          daughter's class had several other girls named Joan, so Celia
          suggested the teacher call her daughter "Ruth" to avoid confusion.

          Bader attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and was a
          member of Alpha Epsilon Phi. She graduated from Cornell with a
          bachelor of arts degree in government on June 23, 1954.

          In the fall of 1956, Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School, where
          she was one of only 9 women in a class of about 500 men. The dean of
          Harvard Law reportedly invited all the female law students to dinner
          at his family home and asked the female law students, including
          Ginsburg, "Why are you at Harvard Law School, taking the place of a
          man?"

        <p class="text-paragraph">
          When her husband took a job in New York City, Ginsburg transferred to
          Columbia Law School and became the first woman to be on two major law
          reviews: the Harvard Law Review and Columbia Law Review. In 1959, she
          earned her law degree at Columbia and tied for first in her class.
